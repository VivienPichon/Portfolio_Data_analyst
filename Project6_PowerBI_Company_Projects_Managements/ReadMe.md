# Roleplay context

In this project, I work for a multinational company, which drives several IT and marketing projects all around the world.
The executive board wants a dashboard that allow them to follow the company's various projects and teams at each development phase.
To do so, they ask me to set up an interactive dashboard where they could follow key performance indicators (KPI) globally, per region and per country.
The KPI of interest are the following:

- Project duration
- Project cost
- Number of deliverables

For each of these KPI, the board wants to compare the planned indicator to its actual value and highlights the projects that have performance gaps.

# Data provided
I was provided with an Excel spreadsheet with several tables of fictional data:

- A table of the planned duration, cost and number of deliverables for each phase of each project
- A table for the actual duration, cost and number of deliverable for each phase of each project
- A table for the type of each project (marketing or IT)
- A table for the country of each project
- A table giving the region of each country

# Main tasks

- Rework the table into a usable and optimised database using PowerQuery
- Calculate new variables with PowerQuery and DAX (End date of each project, ratio between planned and actual indicators...)
- Create an comprehensive and interactive dashboard, which can be filtered using on-page filters and the drill-through feature.

# Dashboard presentation
The dashboard itself can be downloaded from [this link][1].
A link to a short video presenting the dashboard is coming soon.
