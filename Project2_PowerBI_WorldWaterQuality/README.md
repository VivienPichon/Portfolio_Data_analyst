# Portfolio2_PowerBI_WorldWaterQuality

## Roleplay context
In this project I am working in a NGO, which works on giving access to safe water to people around the world. They need a decision-making tool to help them decide in which country they should start new projects, and the nature of the project which should be done in these countries. 
More specifically, the NGO wants to:

- Avoid starting projects in politically unstable countries as changes in administration, civil wars or high corruption prevent projects accomplishment
- Knowing which type of project would be useful by having an overview on the type of water services that are already present. Building new water services is very different than modernizing existing facilities.
- Be aware of the efficiency of the existing water policy in the country by comparing the presence of water facility to the number and rate of death due to unsafe water consumption.

## Dashboard and project presentation
I created a PowerBI dashboard to answer these requirements based on the data provided. You can consult a static overview of the dashboard and its features in the [Dashboard_overview.pdf](https://github.com/VivienPichon/Portfolio2_PowerBI_WorldWaterQuality/blob/main/Dashboard_overview.pdf). If you have powerBI, you can also download the dashboard itself and use it [here](https://github.com/VivienPichon/Portfolio2_PowerBI_WorldWaterQuality/blob/main/Pichon_Vivien_2_dashboard_022025.pbix).

I showed this dashboard in an exam, with the support of the following slides: [Water_quality_slides.pdf](https://github.com/VivienPichon/Portfolio2_PowerBI_WorldWaterQuality/blob/main/Water_quality_slides.pdf).


## Data provided
The data was provided to me by a data engineer and did not need to be corrected.

- The **water service availability and death toll** was found by the [Water, Sanitation and Hygiene project page](https://www.who.int/health-topics/water-sanitation-and-hygiene-wash#tab=tab_1) from the World Health Organization.
- The **world population** per country was taken from the UN [Monthly Bulletin and Statistics Online](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/mbs/app/DataSearchTable.aspx).
- The **political Stability Index** is published by [the World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/).

New variables needed to be calculated, and new links between some tables had to be created.
