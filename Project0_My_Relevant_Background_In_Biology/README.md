# My Background as a biologist

I am working since 2019 on a PhD in microbiology and bioinformatics, which was my first contact with data analysis and vizualisation.

We produced a [short video]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saMKxZvviQc)) to explain simply the goals and means of our project:

For this project, I used bash and R to analyse and interpret Next Generation Sequencing data. The article is still in preparation and I will link it and its code as soon as they are published.
