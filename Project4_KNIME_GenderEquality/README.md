# Project4_KNIME_GenderEquality

Here I use the software KNIME to calculate indicators of gender equality in a fictionnal entreprise. 

## Roleplay context

I am part of a company, which wants to have a high gender equality rating to become more appealing to customers and future employees.
To do so, the HR asks me to reproduce the sex equality index recommended by the French government.

My first task was to find how this index is calculated. As these calculations are made for bigger companies than our, my second task was to adapt these calculations to our dataset, which did not include the socio-professional categories.
Lastly, I calculated the different scores of the index and reported them to HR, as well as recommendations to improve the score in the future.

## Project results and showcase

The project presentation and conclusion can be found [above](https://github.com/VivienPichon/Portfolio_Data_analyst/blob/main/Project4_KNIME_GenderEquality/Project4_presentation_slides.pdf). The [KNIME workflow](https://github.com/VivienPichon/Portfolio_Data_analyst/blob/main/Project4_KNIME_GenderEquality/Pichon_Vivien_1_workflow_KNIME_102024.knwf) and [data](https://github.com/VivienPichon/Portfolio_Data_analyst/tree/main/Project4_KNIME_GenderEquality/data) can be downloaded and tested from this directory.

The KNIME workflow could have been much shorter and optimized, but I decided to keep in it all the pathways to the different charts that I generated. I also added extra steps for when to socio-professional categories will be added in a hypothetical future year.
